Welcome to Vain.Core, the core library for a roguelike game developed in Godot Engine. This library is in its early stages of development and aims to provide essential components and functionality to Vain.


As it is a core library, it is not intended to be used as a standalone game. Instead, it is designed to be used as a part of a larger project.

Documentation and examples will be available once the library is in a more stable state.
